# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Onyx-Bakery-Using-Excel

This analysis was done to help a startup understand their data and make data driven decisons that can increase sales projections. The dataset was gotten from Onyx Dna.This dahsboard was created to be very dynamic and interactive that a simple entrepreneur could see projections overtime according to what they intend to see in the report. 


## Findings and Insights
1. Onyx bakery sells over 7 different flavours of pie, according to the dataset, onyx made a total of 353.45k as total revenue for the year for all flavours of pie.
2. Total cost on the pies summed to 96.92k
4.The total quantity sold in the bakery totalled 8333
5. They sold the least on Sundays and sold the most on Mondays, quite an irony cos I didn't think people rather go the bakery on Mondays instead of Sunday being a weekend.
